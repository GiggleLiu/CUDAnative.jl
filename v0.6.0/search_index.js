    "text": "Requirements:Julia 0.6 with LLVM 3.9 built from source, executed in tree (for LLVM.jl)\nNVIDIA driver, providing libcuda.so (for CUDAdrv.jl)\nCUDA toolkitAlthough that first requirement might sound complicated, it basically means you need to fetch and compile a copy of Julia 0.6 (refer to the main repository's README, checking out the latest tag for 0.6), and execute the resulting julia binary in-place without doing a make install. Afterwards, you can do:Pkg.add(\"CUDAnative\")\nusing CUDAnative\n\n# optionally\nPkg.test(\"CUDAnative\")For now, only Linux and macOS are supported. The build step will discover the available CUDA and LLVM installations, and figure out which devices can be programmed using that set-up. It depends on CUDAdrv and LLVM being properly configured.Even if the build fails, CUDAnative.jl should always be loadable. This simplifies use by downstream packages, until there is proper language support for conditional modules. You can check whether the package has been built properly by inspecting the CUDAnative.configured global variable."

Several parts of the language are downright disallowed, such as calls to the Julia runtime, or garbage allocations. Other features might get reduced in strength, eg. throwing exceptions will result in a trap.If your code is incompatible with GPU execution, the compiler will mention the unsupported feature, and where the use came from:julia> foo(i) = (print(\"can't do this\"); return nothing)\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @cuda (1,1) foo(1)\nERROR: error compiling foo: error compiling print: generic call to unsafe_write requires the runtime language featureIn addition, the JIT doesn't support certain modes of compilation.

The CUDAnative compiler is fully compatible with these tools, and generates the required line number information to debug performance issues.Although CUDAnative exports a @profile macro, it does not serve the same purpose as Base.@profile. Rather, it instructs the CUDA profiler to start right before the first kernel launch. This avoids profiling during the time Julia or CUDAnative precompile code, and result in a much more compact timeline view. If you want to use this feature, disable the nvprof/nvvp option to \"Start profiling at application start\". As with all Julia code, also perform a warm-up iteration without the profiler activated.For true source-level profiling akin to Base.@profile, look at nvvp's PC Sampling View (requires compute capability >= 5.2, CUDA >= 7.5). In the future, we might have a CUDAnative.@profile offering similar functionality, using the NVIDIA CUPTI library."

    "text": "When there's no corresponding libdevice function or PTX back-end intrinsic exposing the required functionality, you can use inline PTX assembly via llvmcall. This requires you to embed the PTX assembly in LLVM IR, which is often messy.If the source of the assembly instructions is CUDA C code, you simplify this task by first compiling the CUDA code using Clang, and adapting the resulting LLVM IR for use within llvmcall. For example, extracting the following function definition from the CUDA SDK:__device__ unsigned int __ballot(int a)\n{\n  int result;\n  asm __volatile__ (\"{ \\n\\t\"\n        \".reg .pred \\t%%p1; \\n\\t\"\n        \"setp.ne.u32 \\t%%p1, %1, 0; \\n\\t\"\n        \"vote.ballot.b32 \\t%0, %%p1; \\n\\t\"\n        \"}\" : \"=r\"(result) : \"r\"(a));\n  return result;\n}We can generate the following LLVM IR by executing clang++ -Xclang -fcuda-is-device -S -emit-llvm -target nvptx64 ballot.cu -o - (you might need to add some CUDA boilerplate):define i32 @_Z8__balloti(i32 %a) #0 {\n  %1 = alloca i32, align 4\n  %result = alloca i32, align 4\n  store i32 %a, i32* %1, align 4\n  %2 = load i32, i32* %1, align 4\n  %3 = call i32 asm sideeffect \"{ \\0A\\09.reg .pred \\09%p1; \\0A\\09setp.ne.u32 \\09%p1, $1, 0; \\0A\\09vote.ballot.b32 \\09$0, %p1; \\0A\\09}\", \"=r,r\"(i32 %2) #1, !srcloc !1\n  store i32 %3, i32* %result, align 4\n  %4 = load i32, i32* %result, align 4\n  ret i32 %4\n}Finally, cleaning this code up we end up with the following llvmcall invocation:ballot_asm = \"\"\"{\n   .reg .pred %p1;\n   setp.ne.u32 %p1, \\$1, 0;\n   vote.ballot.b32 \\$0, %p1;\n}\"\"\"\n\nfunction ballot(pred::Bool)\n    return Base.llvmcall(\n        \"\"\"%2 = call i32 asm sideeffect \"$ballot_asm\", \"=r,r\"(i32 %0)\n           ret i32 %2\"\"\",\n        UInt32, Tuple{Int32}, convert(Int32, pred))\nendIn the future, we will use LLVM.jl to properly embed inline assembly instead of this string-based hackery."
